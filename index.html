            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-font">
                Hello! I am a food lover person. I enjoy trying new foods. Occasionally, the majority of people must purchase food from cafes or restaurants. However, finding healthy meals in a cafe or restaurant is nearly impossible nowadays. Food is a beautiful thing because it can bring people together and help you keep the people you care about near to you. So I made the decision to start a restaurant that serves healthy foods.

                <p>Prepare the fruit with a small serrated knife. Cut the top and bottom off the kiwi, stand it up on one of its flat surfaces and cut away the skin, keeping the knife as close to the skin as possible. Slice in half, following the core through the centre, then cut each half into slices. Put in a bowl and repeat with the other kiwi.Squeeze the membrane over the fruit to extract the juice, add a drizzle of honey </p>
