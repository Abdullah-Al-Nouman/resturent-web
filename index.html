            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-font">
                Hello! I am a food lover person. I enjoy trying new foods. Occasionally, the majority of people must purchase food from cafes or restaurants. However, finding healthy meals in a cafe or restaurant is nearly impossible nowadays. Food is a beautiful thing because it can bring people together and help you keep the people you care about near to you. So I made the decision to start a restaurant that serves healthy foods.
